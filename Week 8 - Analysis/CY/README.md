### Group1DatasetRaw.onehotted.csv
> This is our raw data set, with Income Groups and Regions one-hotted

### correlation_to_all_lister.ipynb
> Creates a list of correlation coefficients between all features, rather than a matrix. Useful for datasets with too many features for a matrix.

> Creates a list of correlation coefficients between all features and a target, rather than a matrix. Useful for datasets with too many features for a matrix.

### feature_importance_bagging.crossval.ipynb
> Uses BaggingRegressor and cross-validation to model the data and create a list of features sorted by importance.

### feature_importance_bagging.crossval.2.ipynb
> Alt version of BaggingRegressor that excludes more features

### feature_importance_lightgbm.crossval.ipynb
> Uses LightGBMRegressor and cross-validation to model the data and create a list of features sorted by importance.

### feature_importance_lightgbm.crossval.2.ipynb
> Alt version of LightGBMRegressor that excludes more features
>
