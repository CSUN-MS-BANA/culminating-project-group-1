A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.","World Bank, Poverty and Inequality Platform. Data are based on primary household survey data obtained from government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments. Data for high-income economies are mostly from the Luxembourg Income Study database. For more information and methodology, please see http://pip.worldbank.org.",Poverty: Income distribution,%,Annual,,"The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.

The Gini index provides a convenient summary measure of the degree of inequality. Data on the distribution of income or consumption come from nationally representative household surveys. Where the original data from the household survey were available, they have been used to calculate the income or consumption shares by quintile. Otherwise, shares have been estimated from the best available grouped data.

The distribution data have been adjusted for household size, providing a more consistent measure of per capita income or consumption. 

The year reflects the year in which the underlying household survey data were collected or, when the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the year data collection started.",The World Bank Group's goal of promoting shared prosperity has been defined as fostering income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the welfare distribution in every country. Gini coefficients are important background information for shared prosperity.,"Gini coefficients are not unique. It is possible for two different Lorenz curves to give rise to the same Gini coefficient. Furthermore it is possible for the Gini coefficient of a developing country to rise (due to increasing inequality of income) while the number of people in absolute poverty decreases. This is because the Gini coefficient measures relative, not absolute, wealth.

Another limitation of the Gini coefficient is that it is not additive across groups, i.e. the total Gini of a society is not equal to the sum of the Gini's for its sub-groups. Thus, country-level Gini coefficients cannot be aggregated into regional or global Gini's, although a Gini coefficient can be computed for the aggregate.

Because the underlying household surveys differ in methods and types of welfare measures collected, data are not strictly comparable across countries or even across years within a country. Two sources of non-comparability should be noted for distributions of income in particular. First, the surveys can differ in many respects, including whether they use income or consumption expenditure as the living standard indicator. The distribution of income is typically more unequal than the distribution of consumption. In addition, the definitions of income used differ more often among surveys. Consumption is usually a much better welfare indicator, particularly in developing countries. Second, households differ in size (number of members) and in the extent of income sharing among members. And individuals differ in age and consumption needs. Differences among countries in these respects may bias comparisons of distribution. 

World Bank staff have made an effort to ensure that the data are as comparable as possible. Wherever possible, consumption has been used rather than income. Income distribution and Gini indexes for high-income economies are calculated directly from the Luxembourg Income Study database, using an estimation method consistent with that applied for developing countries.",The World Bank’s internationally comparable poverty monitoring database now draws on income or detailed consumption data from more than 2000 household surveys across 169 countries.

The index includes three dimensions -- health, education, and living standards.","Alkire, S., Kanagaratnam, U., and Suppa, N. (2023). ‘The global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2023 country results and methodological note’, OPHI MPI Methodological Note 55, Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), University of Oxford. (https://ophi.org.uk/mpi-methodological-note-55-2/)",Poverty: Poverty rates,%,Annual,Datasets are incorporated each year from a moving window starting 12 years before the current year (e.g. 2011 for the global MPI in 2023),"The global MPI, published annually since 2010, captures acute multidimensional poverty in developing regions of the world (Alkire and Santos, 2014). This measure is based on the dual-cutoff counting methodology developed by Alkire and Foster (2011). The global MPI is composed of three dimensions (health, education, and living standards) and 10 indicators (nutrition, child mortality, school attendance, years of schooling, electricity, drinking water, sanitation, cooking fuel, housing, and assets). 

The global MPI begins by constructing a deprivation profile for each household and person in it that tracks deprivations in each of the 10 indicators. For example, a household and all people living in it are deprived if any child is stunted or any child or adult for whom data are available is underweight; if any child died in the past five years; if any school-aged child is not attending school up to the age at which he or she would complete class 8 or no household member has completed six years of schooling; or if the household lacks access to electricity, an improved source of drinking water within a 30 minute walk round trip, an improved sanitation facility that is not shared, nonsolid cooking fuel, durable housing materials, and basic assets such as a radio, animal cart, phone, television, computer, refrigerator, bicycle or motorcycle. 

All indicators are equally weighted within each dimension, so the health and education indicators are weighted 1/6 each, and the standard of living indicators are weighted 1/18 each. A person’s deprivation score is the sum of the weighted deprivations she or he experiences. The global MPI identifies people as multidimensionally poor if their deprivation score is 1/3 or higher. 

MPI values are the product of the incidence (H, or the proportion of population who live in multidimensional poverty) and intensity of poverty (A, or the average deprivation score among multidimensionally poor people). MPI = H × A. 

The MPI ranges from 0 to 1, and higher values imply higher poverty. MPI values decline when fewer people are poor or when poor people have fewer deprivations.","The global MPI was developed Sabina Alkire and Maria Emma Santos (2014), in collaboration with the Human Development Report Office (HDRO) at UNDP as an internationally comparable measure of acute poverty. Technically, the global MPI relies on the Alkire-Foster method (2011). In 2018, five out of the ten indicators have been revised to better align with the SDGs (see Alkire, Kanagaratnam, Nogales and Suppa 2022; Alkire and Kanagaratnam 2020; Alkire and Jahan 2018).","Besides the frequency and timeliness of survey data, other limitations include if the household survey data being used is missing any of the 10 indicators, that indicator is dropped from the calculation. The weights are then adjusted so that each dimension continues to be given a weight of one-third. MPI poverty estimates are only calculated if at least one indicator in health and education dimensions is available, and if at least four indicators in the living standards dimension are available.",,"The global MPI is estimated using comprehensive household survey data, which is largely provided by the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys programme (MICS) and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program. For a few countries, data from national household surveys that are comparable to DHS and MICS is used.",,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by

The Multidimensional Poverty Measure includes three dimensions – monetary poverty, education, and basic infrastructure services – to capture a more complete picture of poverty.","World Bank, Poverty and Inequality Platform. Data are based on primary household survey data obtained from government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments. Data for high-income economies are mostly from the Luxembourg Income Study database. For more information and methodology, please see http://pip.worldbank.org.",Poverty: Poverty rates,%,Annual,,"The World Bank's Multidimensional Poverty Measure (MPM) seeks to understand poverty beyond monetary deprivations by including access to education and basic infrastructure along with the monetary headcount ratio at the $2.15 international poverty line.
The measure takes inspiration and guidance from other prominent global multidimensional measures, particularly the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Oxford University but differs from them in one important aspect: it includes monetary poverty less than $2.15 per day, the new International Poverty Line at 2017 PPP (Purchasing Power Parity), as one of the dimensions. 
The MPM is composed of six indicators: consumption or income, educational attainment, educational enrollment, drinking water, sanitation, and electricity. These are mapped into three dimensions of well-being: monetary, education, and basic infrastructure services.
The three MPM dimensions are weighted equally, and within each dimension each indicator is also weighted equally. Individuals are considered multidimensionally deprived if they fall short of the threshold in at least one dimension or in a combination of indicators equivalent in weight to a full dimension. In other words, households will be considered poor if they are deprived in indicators whose weight adds up to 1/3 or more. Because the monetary dimension is measured using only one indicator, anyone who is income poor is automatically also poor under the multidimensional poverty measure. 
Summarizing the information on the different deprivations into a single index proves useful in making comparisons across populations and across time. However, any aggregation of indicators into a single index always involves a decision on how each indicator is to be weighted.","Monitoring poverty is important on the global development agenda as well as on the national development agenda of many countries. The first Sustainable Development Goal calls for ending poverty in all forms by 2030. Poverty is multidimensional, containing both monetary and non-monetary dimensions. The World Bank's multidimensional poverty measure captures both elements, allowing for a more complete tracking of poverty in all forms","Despite progress in the last decade, the challenges of measuring poverty remain. The timeliness, frequency, quality, and comparability of household surveys need to increase substantially, particularly in the poorest countries. The availability and quality of poverty monitoring data remains low in small states, countries with fragile situations, and low-income countries and even some middle-income countries. The low frequency and lack of comparability of the data available in some countries create uncertainty over the magnitude of poverty reduction. 

Besides the frequency and timeliness of survey data, other data quality issues arise in measuring household living standards. The surveys ask detailed questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be carefully recorded by trained personnel. Income is generally more difficult to measure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion of living standards. And income can vary over time even if living standards do not. But consumption data are not always available: the latest estimates reported here use consumption data for about two-thirds of countries.

However, even similar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences in timing or in the quality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also pose a potential problem because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, particularly important in underdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure but may not be.

Countries have different definitions of poverty, and consistent comparisons across countries can be difficult. Local poverty lines tend to have higher purchasing power in rich countries, where more generous standards are used, than in poor countries.

Since World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world's poorest countries. The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using purchasing power parities (PPPs), was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in September 2022, when we adopted $2.15 as the international poverty line using the 2017 PPP. Poverty measures based on international poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries, as is done when making comparisons over time. The $3.65 poverty line is derived from typical national poverty lines in countries classified as Lower Middle Income. The $6.85 poverty line is derived from typical national poverty lines in countries classified as Upper Middle Income.

Early editions of World Development Indicators used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency to equivalent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993, 2005, and 2017 consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank.

Data are compiled from official government sources or are computed by World Bank staff using national (i.e. country–specific) poverty lines.",Poverty: Poverty rates,%,Annual,,"Poverty headcount ratio among the population is measured based on national (i.e. country-specific) poverty lines. A country may have a unique national poverty line or separate poverty lines for rural and urban areas, or for different geographic areas to reflect differences in the cost of living or sometimes to reflect differences in diets and consumption baskets.

Poverty estimates at national poverty lines are computed from household survey data collected from nationally representative samples of households. These data must contain sufficiently detailed information to compute a comprehensive estimate of total household income or consumption (including consumption or income from own production), from which it is possible to construct a correctly weighted distribution of per capita consumption or income. 

National poverty lines are the benchmark for estimating poverty indicators that are consistent with the country's specific economic and social circumstances. National poverty lines reflect local perceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor. The perceived boundary between poor and non-poor typically rises with the average income of a country and thus does not provide a uniform measure for comparing poverty rates across countries. While poverty rates at national poverty lines should not be used for comparing poverty rates across countries, they are appropriate for guiding and monitoring the results of country-specific national poverty reduction strategies. 

Almost all national poverty lines in developing economies are anchored to the cost of a food bundle - based on the prevailing national diet of the poor - that provides adequate nutrition for good health and normal activity, plus an allowance for nonfood spending. National poverty lines must be adjusted for inflation between survey years to remain constant in real terms and thus allow for meaningful comparisons of poverty over time. Because diets and consumption baskets change over time, countries periodically recalculate the poverty line based on new survey data. In such cases the new poverty lines should be deflated to obtain comparable poverty estimates from earlier years. 

This series only includes estimates that to the best of our knowledge are reasonably comparable over time for a country. For economies for which the data are from EU-SILC, the reported year is the income reference year, which is the year before the survey year.

The Societal Poverty Line is expressed in purchasing power adjusted 2017 U.S. dollars and defined as max($2.15, $1.15 + 0.5*Median). This means that when the national median is sufficiently low, the Societal Poverty line is equivalent to the extreme poverty line, $2.15. For countries with a sufficiently high national median, the Societal Poverty Line grows as countries’ median income grows.","World Bank, Poverty and Inequality Platform. Data are based on primary household survey data obtained from government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments. Data for high-income economies are mostly from the Luxembourg Income Study database. For more information and methodology, please see http://pip.worldbank.org.",Poverty: Poverty rates,%,Annual,,"The Societal Poverty Line (SPL) adopted by the World Bank is calculated in 2017 PPP U.S. dollars as follows: SPL = max (US$2.15, US$1.15 + 0.5 median consumption). By this definition, societal poverty represents a combination of extreme poverty, which is fixed in value for everyone, and a relative dimension of well-being that differs in every country depending on the median level of consumption in that country. In countries with low median consumption (less than US$2.00 per person per day), a rise in median consumption does not change the SPL. Indeed, the SPL has the same value as the IPL in all countries with median consumption at less than US$2.00. However, as countries with median consumption at more than US$2.00 become richer, and the median consumption increases, the value of the SPL also rises. The slope of one-half, the rate at which the SPL is rising as countries become richer, comes from the empirical association observed between national poverty lines and different measures of overall consumption in society. It indicates that, on average, the national poverty lines are increasing at a rate equal to half the median consumption in the countries. The slope of one-half and the intercept of US$1.15 are the values that most closely fit the data provided by the national poverty lines and overall consumption in each country. The SPL and the International Poverty Line (IPL) share the same empirical underpinning. Both are anchored in the distribution of national poverty lines, which represent countries’ own judgements of what poverty means for them. Whereas the IPL focuses narrowly—and deliberately—on the choices of some of the poorest countries, the SPL is built on information from across the whole range of levels of development. In addition to fitting the data well, the slope coefficient of half the median is widely used by many countries and organizations as a measure of relative poverty and inclusion.","Monitoring poverty is important on the global development agenda as well as on the national development agenda of many countries. The first Sustainable Development Goal calls for ending poverty in all forms by 2030. Typically, countries' poverty lines increase in real value as their economies get richer. Essentially, this is because in a richer country it is costlier to participate in society (i.e., be considered non-poor). Yet as relative poverty lines can take on very low values for poor countries, one may want to ensure a lower bound which provides a fixed, absolute element to the SPL, which the study interprets as the cost of consuming some minimum bundle of goods. The Societal Poverty Line tracks poverty rates consistent with these considerations.","Despite progress in the last decade, the challenges of measuring poverty remain.
