/*
to use with sqlite cli to produce csv of pivoted qpsd data 
with each country's year and quarter on one row,
e.g. 
australia 2021 Q1
australia 2021 Q2

this version pivots the lengthy indicator names to column headers

then run these commands in the prompt:
.open qpsd_database.db
.mode csv
.headers on
.output qpsd_pivoted_names.csv
.read pivot_qpds_names.sql
.output stdout
