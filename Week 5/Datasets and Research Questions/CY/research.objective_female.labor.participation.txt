Research Objective: To investigate female labor participation to determine if there are any actionable insights to recommend to world leaders

Classification
    Indicators:
        Employment in agriculture, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate) 
        Employment in industry, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate) 
        Employment in services, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate) 
	GDP per capita (current US$) 
        Government Effectiveness: Estimate 
	Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)
	Regulatory Quality: Estimate 
        Unemployment, female (% of female labor force) (modeled ILO estimate) 
        Wage and salaried workers, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate) 
    Research Questions:
        Can countries be classified into economic structures based on female employment distribution across agriculture, industry, and services? 
        Do more developed economies show higher female participation in services rather than industry or agriculture? 
        Can countries be categorized based on governance quality and female labor force inclusion? 
        Do stronger governance frameworks lead to lower female unemployment rates? 
Clustering
    Indicators:
        Employment in agriculture, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate) 
        Employment in industry, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate) 
        Employment in services, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate) 
	GDP per capita (current US$) 
        Government Effectiveness: Estimate 
        Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)
        Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments (%)        
	Regulatory Quality: Estimate 
        Unemployment, female (% of female labor force) (modeled ILO estimate)    
    Research Questions:
        Are there clusters of countries with distinct female employment sectoral trends? 
        How do economic diversification and sectoral employment shifts impact female employment? 
        Are there clusters of countries where high governance effectiveness aligns with higher female workforce participation? 
        How do governance-driven labor markets differ in female employment stability? 
Correlation
    Indicators (maybe just try all):
	Employment in agriculture, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
	Employment in industry, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
	Employment in services, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
	GDP per capita (current US$) 
        Government Effectiveness: Estimate 
	Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)
        Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments (%) 
        Wage and salaried workers, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)         
    Research Questions:
        Is higher GDP per capita correlated with a shift from agriculture to services in female employment? 
        Does economic growth impact female labor force transitions across sectors? 
        Is stronger governance effectiveness correlated with higher female labor force participation? 
        Does political representation of women impact female wage employment levels? 
Linear Regression
    Dependent Variable: Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)
    Independent Variables:
        Government Effectiveness: Estimate 
        Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments (%) 
        Wage and salaried workers, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate) 
    Research Questions:
        How does governance effectiveness impact female labor force participation? 
        Does increasing womenâ€™s political representation drive female employment? 
		
    Dependent Variable: Employment in services, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
    Independent Variables:
        GDP per capita (current US$) 
        Employment in agriculture, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate) 
        Employment in industry, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate) 
    Research Questions:
        Does economic growth predict female employment shifts toward services? 
        How do industry and agriculture employment influence service sector employment for women? 
Time Series
    Indicators:
        Government Effectiveness: Estimate 
        Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) 
        Unemployment, female (% of female labor force) (modeled ILO estimate) 
        Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments (%) 
    Research Questions:
        How has governance effectiveness influenced female labor force participation over time? 
        Is there a lag between political representation gains and improved labor force participation? 
    
	Indicators:
        Employment in agriculture, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
