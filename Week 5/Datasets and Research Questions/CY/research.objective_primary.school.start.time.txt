Research Objective: To investigate if the age at which children begin primary school influences various aspects of the labor market. Segregating results by male/female is optional. A variation of this objective could focus on primary school duration.

Classification:
	Indicators: 
		Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in agriculture, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in agriculture, male (% of male employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in industry (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in industry, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in industry, male (% of male employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in services (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in services, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in services, male (% of male employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Labor force participation rate, male (% of male population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Labor force participation rate, total (% of total population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Primary school starting age (years)
		Vulnerable employment, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Vulnerable employment, male (% of male employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Vulnerable employment, total (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
	Research Questions: 
		Can countries be classified into distinct groups based on their primary school starting age and the structure of their labor markets (e.g., agricultural vs. industrial vs. service-based)? 
		Does a later primary school starting age correlate with a higher likelihood of a country being classified as having a more developed and less vulnerable labor market? 
Clustering:
	Indicators: 
		GDP per capita (current US$) 
		Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Labor force participation rate, male (% of male population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Labor force participation rate, total (% of total population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate) 
		Primary school starting age (years) 
		Ratio of female to male labor force participation rate (%) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Unemployment, youth total (% of total labor force ages 15-24) (modeled ILO estimate)
	Research Questions: 
		Do countries with similar primary school starting ages cluster together in terms of unemployment rates, female labor force participation, and economic development? 
		Are there identifiable clusters where a later starting age correlates with lower unemployment, greater gender parity in the workforce, and higher GDP per capita? 
Correlation:
	Indicators (maybe just try all): 
		Contributing family workers, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Contributing family workers, male (% of male employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Contributing family workers, total (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment to population ratio, 15+, total (%) (modeled ILO estimate) 
		Primary school starting age (years) 
		Wage and salaried workers, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Wage and salaried workers, male (% of male employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Wage and salaried workers, total (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
	Research Questions: 
		Is there a significant correlation between primary school starting age and the overall employment-to-population ratio? 
		How does primary school starting age correlate with the prevalence of wage and salaried employment versus contributing family work, which may indicate the quality of employment? 
Linear Regression:
	Indicators: 
		Dependent: Unemployment, youth total (% of total labor force ages 15-24) (modeled ILO estimate) 
		Independent: Primary school starting age (years), Secondary education, duration (years), GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$) 
	Research Questions: 
		Does primary school starting age significantly predict youth unemployment rates, controlling for secondary education duration and GDP per capita? 
		How much of the variance in youth unemployment can be explained by primary school starting age, considering the length of secondary education and economic development? 
Time Series:
	Indicators: 
		Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in agriculture, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in agriculture, male (% of male employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in industry (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in industry, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in industry, male (% of male employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in services (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in services, female (% of female employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Employment in services, male (% of male employment) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Labor force participation rate, male (% of male population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)
		Labor force participation rate, total (% of total population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate) 
		Primary school starting age (years) 
	Research Questions: 
		How has the relationship between primary school starting age and the sectoral composition of the labor market (agriculture, industry, services) evolved over time within specific countries? 
		Are there time lags between changes in primary school starting age and observable shifts in labor force participation and the distribution of employment across different sectors?
